# BOB

BOB is an easy-to-use and a friendly theme made in HTML/CSS with Javascript. The theme was made from an exsisting template and mdoified to make it look more funky with a bit of black and white. The theme can be used, edited and can even be used for commercial purposes. To support the project, you can contribute to the code or just support me though [Patreon](https://patreon.com/solomonlijo).

# Prerequisite

- Atom/Visual Studio Code

The main part of coding, an IDE. I would recommand, [Atom](https://github.com/atom) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). The reason I would recommand this IDE because of it's ease of access
and it has tons of extensions that will be helpful. The other reason, being only that both of them takes only
upto 300 MB. 

- Git

Git will be for pushing the code to the repository. Using git you can push/pull the code, if you have both git and atom/vs-code
than you can push the code inside the editor without a terminal. If you want to know on how to push the code, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpNJeJbVGto). 


# Hosting

To host the website, make a repository and name it in this format - ```username.github.io```. Once your done, push the code into the repository and the website should be online, the main page of the website should be labeled as ```index.html``` in order for github to make it as the main page. You can also host the repo through [vercel](vercel.com) or [netify](netify.com).
